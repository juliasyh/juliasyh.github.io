[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://ralobos.github.io/files/CV_RLOBOS_OCT_2023.pdf)

My name is Julia Seungyeon Han, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research focuses on multi-scale cardiovascular and computational modeling, bridging the gap from cellular mechanisms to organ-level dynamics. Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis, immersing myself in books, learning new languages, and traveling to explore diverse cities and cultures.
